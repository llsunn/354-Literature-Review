# CPSC354 Homework 3: LLM Literature Review
Name: Lauren Sun

## Overview:
For this week's assignment, I used ChatGPT to explore the impact that artificial intelligence has had on the healthcare industry.

Questions that are addressed include:
* How has the question been addressed in the past? What are the historical developments?
* Which subfields of PL contributed to investigating the question?
* How did these subfields influence each other?
* Who are the influential researchers who left their mark on the field?
* What are some influential research articles, books, software, etc?

## Historical Developments of AI in Healthcare
* 1972: MYCIN was an AI expert system that was created at Stanford University that was used to diagnose and treat bacterial infecitons. It could recommend antibiotics based on patient symptoms and labs.
* 1990s: telemedicine became more popular, and the use of video calls and remote monitoring tools allowed patients in more rural reas to consult with healthcare professionals remotely.
* Early 2000s: Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems were created to help interpret medical images like X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and more. 
* 2010s: Eventually, the concept of personalized medicine began to gain traction. AI models used patient data to predict treatments for patients. 
* 2020s: During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI was implemented to predict outbreaks, diagnose the illness, and optimize hospital workflows. 
* Currently, AI is being used to help discover new drugs to help find cures, create more personalized treatments, improve accessibility, and more. 

## Subfields that Contributed to AI in Healthcare and How They Influenced Each Other
The use of programming languages within the healthcare industry has changed drastically over the years. Early AI systems like MYCIN were primarily written in Lisp and Prolog to create a symbolic AI. However, due to the need for scalable and high-performance solutions, a shift was made from the early AI languages to languages like Python, R, Java, and C++ to implement a more data-driven AI. Using a machine-learning based AI allowed the model to learn more and adapt to the everchanging healthcare field.
MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System) was created in the 1960s and was key in the development of early medical applications of AI. It laid the groundwork for more advanced AI-driven medical informatics systems, and while it is still used today, it is slowly being pushed out by more modern AI systems. Other subfields include natural language processing that allowed AI systems to process and understand medical documents, computer vision relating to medical imaging and telemedicine, and human-computer interaction to optimize interactions between healthcare professionals, patients, and the AI systems.


## Influential Researchers:
* Fei-Fei Li: Her work on ImageNet has helped significantly in training deep learning models in computer vision and has impacted medical imaging to allow for better image analysis and disease detection.
* Eric Topol: His work has influenced the development and adoption of AI-driven tools and technologies in healthcare. This includes wearable devices and remote monitoring systems.
* James Zou: His work on using AI to understand genetics, predict disease risk, and develop personalized treatments has contributed greatly to an increase in more personalized and effective treatments. 
* Dr. Neil P. G., Dr. John H. McDonald, Dr. Peter L. H.: These three created MUMPS, which as discussed above was crucial in the implementation of AI in the healthcare industry.

## A Conversation with ChatGPT
Below is a list of questions asked along with a summary of ChatGPT's responses.

* Question: What kind of programming languages were used for the early AI models compared to now in the healthcare industry?
    * Lisp is a functional programming language that is based on lambda calculus. Prolog is a declarative programming languages based on first-order predicate logic. They are two of the most influential programming languages in the history of artificial intelligence development. The two were more focused on symbolic computation, recursion, and declarative knowledge and reasoning. There has since been a switch to using languages like Python and Java because the more modern languages are more flexible, have more extensive libraries, and broader applicability in today's AI research and development.
* Question: What is some of the current research about the implementation of AI in the healthcare industry?
    * Current research in AI in healthcare focus on many different areas, including improving diagnostic accuracy and predictive analystics for early disease detection, advancing personalized medicine through genomics and tailored drug development, enhancing clinical decision support systems (CDSS) with real-time recommendations, and optimizing healthcare operations through AI-driven management tools. AI is also improving remote monitoring through wearable devices and telemedicine platforms to better patient outcomes, streamline healthcare delivery, adapt treatments to individual needs, and discover new ways to treat people. 
* Question: How have ethical considerations in AI development influenced healthcare applications?
    * Ethical considerations in AI development have significantly influenced healthcare applications by addressing issues such as bias and fairness, transparency and explainability, privacy and data security, informed consent and autonomy, accountability, and human-AI collaboration. There are currently efforts to develop algorithms to identify biases, create legal and ethical frameworks to address liability and responsability issues, and overall make models more transparent to try to address these issues.
* Question: What are the key challenges in integrating AI with existing healthcare systems and workflows?
    * Some challenges include data integration and interoperability, quality, workflow alignment, regulatory compliance, trust, cost, ethical considerations, and change management. One of the bigger challenges is data integration because the effectiveness of AI tools depends heavily on the quality and comprehensiveness of the data that they use (Note from class: Remember AI is only as good as the training data.). It's important to overcome this issue in order to ensure that the systems can provide accurate and actionable help.
* Question: What future trends are anticipated in the use of AI in healthcare?
    * The future of AI in healthcare will likely involve enhancing what people are currently working on, such as more advancements in personalized medicine, diagnostics, drug discovery, remote monitoring, and operational efficiency. Some prospects also include being used in combination with AR/VR, integrative and functional medicine, and more relating to mental and behavior health (diagnoses, personalized care, etc).
